00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,396
Oh, so sleepy.

10
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:50,926
I woke up way too early.

11
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,530
You look good in school uniform.

12
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:55,664
Right?

13
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:59,692
Don't worry too much.
All kids in this class are nice.

14
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,916
Okay.

15
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,331
Shall we?

16
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,597
What did you just say?

17
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:11,398
But it's true, man.

18
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:19,968
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

19
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,713
Quiet down!

20
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:24,473
There's a new student in our class.

21
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,078
- Make a short introduction.
- Yes.

22
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,872
Hello, I'm new at
Wooyeon Arts School.

23
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,484
I'm Yoon... Se...

24
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,515
Eh?

25
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:41,271
Yoon Se what?

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,989
He's probably nervous
because of you guys.

27
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,682
- Se-heon?
- Yes?

28
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:52,812
Oh. Uh, I'm Yoon Se-heon.

29
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:55,927
So cute.

30
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:58,333
Se-heon's major is classical piano.

31
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,947
He's long been homeschooled.
This is his first art school.

32
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,322
You guys are gonna help him
adjust to our school, right?

33
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,859
- Yes.
- Yes.

34
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,675
- Suh Do-yoon?
- Yes?

35
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:11,406
- Se-heon, sit next to him.
- Yes.

36
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,928
Get that bag off of there.

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,252
- Hi.
- Hi.

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,801
- I'm Suh Do-yoon.
- Nice to meet you.

39
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,393
Is that a drum?

40
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:31,682
Hm, yes. Snare drum.

41
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,614
After this period,
give him a tour, Do-yoon.

42
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,614
Yes, I will.

43
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:38,706
All right, where were we?

44
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:43,966
Ah, today's lesson is music
development in the Renaissance.

45
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,779
In Renaissance, music had
great religious significance.

46
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:52,575
Artistically, its patterns
were more developed.

47
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:58,707
Hymns and instrumental songs
were developed denominationally.

48
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:18,935
Hey.

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,205
What? You startled me.

50
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:26,116
What are you doing?
Playing merchants?

51
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,912
Just doing homework.
What do you want?

52
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,037
- What's that?
- Butt out.

53
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:36,480
Jeez, this is so embarrassing.

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,899
Gonna give it to Han Tae-yi?

55
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,173
Hey.

56
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,283
This girl.

57
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,014
That was an infirmary.

58
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:53,866
The cafeteria is on that side.
Snack shop is in the back.

59
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:58,250
The gym is at the end of the hallway.
About 30 meters away.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,312
I assume you know
where the teachers' lounge is.

61
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:05,845
Must I tell you about the guardhouse?
But it's good to know. It's...

62
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,543
Hey, what are you doing there?

63
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,242
What's this room?

64
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,871
What else? The piano practice room.

65
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,751
The one I used yesterday
looked nothing like this.

66
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:21,303
Where?

67
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:24,074
It was dirty
and there was an old piano.

68
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:29,195
- Ah. You were in the haunted one.
- Haunted?

69
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,104
Yes. That was
the old practice room.

70
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:35,130
I heard they were gonna tear it down.
It hasn't been maintained.

71
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,994
- But the piano still worked.
- Really?

72
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:39,282
(Occupied)

73
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:42,094
But there's a rumor it's haunted,
so no one goes there.

74
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,740
I kinda get it. Its condition...

75
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,734
Jeez, it's not haunted.

76
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,619
Jeez? Jeez...
"Jesus, save me" more like.

77
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,672
I didn't wanna tell you this.

78
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,354
Come here.

79
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:05,219
People hear weird noises
when they walk past that room.

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,670
Weird noises?

81
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,161
Excuse me?

82
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,290
Wait a minute.

83
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,450
What's wrong?

84
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,168
So that piano sound...

85
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,224
- I think I heard something.
- Huh?

86
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,749
Holy shit!

87
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,218
I'm serious. I was standing
at the door and the piano stopped.

88
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,417
- For real?
- Mm.

89
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:52,526
Lots of people practice piano
in an art school.

90
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:53,870
You must have misheard.

91
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,297
Really?

92
00:06:57,432 --> 00:07:00,916
So I can't use
that practice room ever?

93
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:02,969
It's not forbidden or anything.

94
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,977
No one maintains it, right?

95
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,083
I told you. No one uses it.

96
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:13,880
Tae-yi, where have you been?

97
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,219
You two close?

98
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:28,514
- Why?
- Eh? Uh, I'm just curious.

99
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,524
- He's my boyfriend.
- Your boyfriend?!

100
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,420
Where did your mind go?

101
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,055
If your friend's a boy,
he's your boy friend.

102
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:45,265
You could have just said a friend.

103
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,652
You're adorable.

104
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:50,702
He's Han Tae-yi.

105
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:52,837
We're quite close.

106
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:55,081
Does he play piano too?

107
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,938
Maybe a little.
He's a trumpet major.

108
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:04,068
Trumpet? That douchebag?

109
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:11,479
- Are you falling for him?
- Huh? What?

110
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,848
You keep staring at him.
Falling for him?

111
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,753
What the hell?
You're giving me the creeps.

112
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,208
What about you?

113
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,613
What about me?

114
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,832
Your piano playing. Are you good?

115
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,295
I'm not that good.

116
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,947
Aside from classical,
what genre do you like?

117
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,828
- Jazz.
- Jazz?

118
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:41,451
Ba-doo-bi-doo,
bab-bam-ba-dam-ba? Like that?

119
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:45,208
Something like that. That's jazz.

120
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,703
You're weird.

121
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,903
Keep eating. Eat.

122
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,031
I was busy thinking about piano
I completely forgot.

123
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:07,254
I forgot the fact that
I don't have friends.

124
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,130
- Why?
- What?

125
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,608
Interested in the newbie?

126
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,151
No.

127
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,801
I feel bad. Should we invite him?

128
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,823
He's been staring at you.

129
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,362
He said he loved jazz too.

130
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,973
Who asked you?

131
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,223
No one.

132
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:02,758
This is delicious.

133
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,427
Try it.

134
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,968
Why is he staring at me?

135
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,843
Did he find out
I played there this morning?

136
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,319
- Miss?
- Hm?

137
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:39,503
The piano room is occupied.
Aren't there any unoccupied ones?

138
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,062
Did you book the room?

139
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,763
Book the room?

140
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,404
To play outside of practical
classes, you have to sign up.

141
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,841
When will I get the room
after I book it?

142
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:52,748
- About a month afterward.
- What? A month?

143
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:56,628
Lots of people use this room,
so it's always booked.

144
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,836
You have to play at home for now.

145
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:04,144
- Why? No piano at home?
- It's not that.

146
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,419
But there's a reason...

147
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:11,028
- Thank you.
- Sure. Practice hard.

148
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,009
Well done, everyone.

149
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,569
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

150
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:25,747
Aren't you going home?

151
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,090
Eh? I'll leave soon.

152
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,685
Let's go.

153
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,343
- Se-heon?
- Huh?

154
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:42,635
See you tomorrow.

155
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,161
Ah. Get home safe.

156
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,429
Why are you being nice to him?

157
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,278
Jealous?

158
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,669
Ow, ow. I get it now. Let me go.

159
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,102
That's Ju-hee.

160
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:09,772
- Hey.
- Hm?

161
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,616
- You go ahead.
- Mm. Eh?

162
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,792
- Why?
- Make something up.

163
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,944
- As my birthday present.
- What do you want me to do?

164
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,516
Senior Do-yoon?

165
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:38,751
Where's Senior Tae-yi?

00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,230
Tae-yi?

167
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:45,062
He already left.

168
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,407
Really? Why didn't I see him?

169
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,739
- What's up?
- No.

170
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,782
- I'm gonna go.
- Please.

171
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,985
- I'm going that way.
- Yes.

172
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,592
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

173
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:31,332
But there's a rumor it's haunted,
so no one goes there.

174
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,210
Is anyone here?

175
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,619
Ghosts aren't scary.
Not playing piano is scarier.

176
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,467
He probably won't show up again.

177
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,274
Which song should I play?

178
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,708
I gave you a clear warning.

179
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:14,067
If you play piano here, you die.

180
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,150
Did you ignore my warning?

181
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,463
Hold on. Isn't this a bit overkill?

182
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:35,984
- What is?
- I saw no one use this room.

183
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:37,885
Aren't you being power-crazed?

184
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,640
- And I only play after school.
- You play in the morning too.

185
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,666
Like a sewer rat.

186
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:49,879
You're crossing the line.

187
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,432
Just stay away,
no matter the hours.

188
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,641
Aside from this place, I don't...

189
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,246
Can you tell me the reason?

190
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,749
Must I destroy this piano
so you stop coming?

191
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,019
Are you crazy?

192
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:05,677
I'll explain again.

193
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:10,263
No matter what,
you have one choice.

194
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,648
Get lost. Do you understand?

195
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:18,203
- No, I don't.
- Huh?

196
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,505
I don't acknowledge it.

197
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,852
Jeez, you're so annoying.

198
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,645
That hurts. Get off me.

199
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:34,986
Do you have to get hurt to stop?
Do I have to break your wrist?

200
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,760
Why are you doing this?
Can't you tell me the reason?!

201
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:38,879
Shut up.

202
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,406
- Then go on and break it!
- You're asking for it.

203
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:45,858
Even if I have to die...
Even then, I'm gonna play!

204
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,373
Yeah, I love it.

205
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:51,935
I love playing this song
so much I'd die for it.

206
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,804
Get off me!

207
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:34,702
S... sorry.

208
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:36,952
But you started...

209
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,548
Don't do this.

210
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:54,846
What are you two doing?

211
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,872
The practice room is booked,
so I came here to practice.

212
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,691
But he grabbed me and shoved me.

213
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:11,153
- Grabbed and shoved?
- Yes.

214
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:18,186
Then we were spinning
and I landed on him.

215
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,504
- Landed on him?
- Eh?

216
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:25,998
Then this guy got on top of me.

217
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:29,723
- Hey, shut up.
- Mm. Got on top of you?

218
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:31,206
It's all true.

219
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,097
Can I go?

220
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,800
Where are you going?
We're not finished.

221
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,764
What's next? After he got on top.

222
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:48,423
We weren't doing anything weird.
The situation was just...

223
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:56,046
Jeez, so funny. What's your name?

224
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,316
Yoon Se-heon.

225
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,827
Mm. Yoon Se-heon?

226
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,629
- Okay, you can go.
- Eh?

227
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,308
You can go. I have to talk to him.

228
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,027
Oh. Sure.

229
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
I was looking for you.

230
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,134
I was wondering where you went
after ditching Ju-hee.

231
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:34,655
But this...

232
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,706
cracked me up.

233
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:39,919
Don't push it, Senior.

234
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,250
Ju-hee was up all night
making you a present.

235
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,300
How much would this hurt her?

236
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:49,201
I'm gonna go.

237
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,518
Don't cross the line, Han Tae-yi.

238
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,331
Let go.

239
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:00,034
Tae-yi.

240
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,003
If...

241
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:08,800
my sister ever cries
over your name,

242
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:13,762
I wouldn't be able to hold back.

243
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Understood?

244
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,393
But, Yoon Se-heon...

245
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,689
that guy is cute.

246
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,288
I was getting bored
being back in school.

247
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,279
He makes this more fun.

248
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,441
Do whatever you want.

249
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:55,992
Give it here.

250
00:20:58,313 --> 00:21:00,058
How did you hurt your hand?

251
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,219
Don't you know hands
are a pianist's treasure?

252
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,719
It got smashed on something.

253
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,662
How's school?

254
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,948
Good. I made a friend.

255
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:21,358
Not like that.
Do you know how popular I am?

256
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,035
Don't have too much fun.

257
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:25,939
I won't.

258
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:29,661
Time spent with friends
is less time spent practicing.

259
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:31,614
Friends...

260
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,526
If you want something,
you have to lose something.

261
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,041
I know that.

262
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,583
I've been taught that all my life.

263
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:45,997
Done. How is it? Can you manage?

264
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,369
- Excellent.
- Don't practice today. Go rest.

265
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:55,475
Mm.

266
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:11,765
Ever since the first day,
things keep escalating.

267
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,041
What is the real reason?

268
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,432
Don't do this.

269
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,505
Why would he do that?

270
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:25,146
I hope you're okay,

271
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:28,338
Han Tae-yi.

272
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:32,895
Ow.

273
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,130
Why am I feeling
sorry for that thug?

274
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:39,619
It's so frustrating.

275
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:44,475
Take your time.

276
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,270
Slowly.

277
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:48,769
That's it.

278
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,239
Oh, Sung Ju-ha!

279
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,468
- Hello, Senior!
- Hello, Senior!

280
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:56,528
- Can I join you?
- Of course.

281
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,033
It's been a while.

282
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,098
Pass it here. Pass it.

283
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,357
Pass it. Pass it.

284
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,150
Okay!

285
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:15,232
Hey, Suh Do-yoon,
can't you mark him properly?

286
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:17,100
Sure.

287
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:29,041
Jeez, this is so annoying. Shit.

288
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:32,772
Hey, that was too much.

289
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,686
That was a foul.
He gets a free throw.

290
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:03,454
- This way! Pass it!
- Go, go!

291
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:26,581
Hey.

292
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:30,451
Han Tae-yi!

293
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:36,987
Can we talk?

294
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:52,888
What?

295
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,664
I wanted to make it clear.

296
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:59,446
I'm gonna play piano there.

297
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,596
You wouldn't tell me
your special reason.

298
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,558
- Do whatever you want.
- What?

299
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:08,690
I'm going if you're done.

300
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:10,478
Hold on.

301
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,893
At least tell me
why you hate it so much.

302
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,596
I owe you an explanation?

303
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:20,227
You do. You were being
completely unreasonable.

304
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,482
You threatened to hurt me
out of the blue.

305
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:25,812
Now you're letting me
do what I want.

306
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:27,850
I didn't wanna hear it.

307
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:31,688
- Huh?
- I didn't like how you played.

308
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,070
How would you know?

309
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:40,128
Have you really listened?

310
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:41,565
You sound confident.

311
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,129
So what if I am?

312
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:45,195
- Then play.
- Huh?

313
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:48,526
Play, so I can really listen.

314
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,550
This isn't how I planned.

315
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,465
How did things turn out this way?

316
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,969
If he keeps staring...

317
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,131
how can I possibly play?

318
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:11,031
- Hey.
- Huh?

319
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Aren't you gonna play?

320
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,790
Uh... It feels like
you don't like jazz. Is there...

321
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,085
a song you want to hear?

322
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,600
Play any song.
The one you're confident in.

323
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,788
Then... Here we go.

324
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:05,859
How's that?

325
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:13,766
I asked how it was.

326
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:18,684
Figured...

327
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,432
I hated it.

328
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:29,340
- What?
- Hated it.

329
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Hey, wait.

330
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:36,981
That's all?

331
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,507
Do whatever.

332
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:43,524
I don't care anymore.
It's your business.

333
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:47,788
Hey!

334
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,354
They're so alike.

335
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:30,340
Is this possible?

336
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:32,694
Or I've gone...

337
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:35,590
batshit crazy?

338
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:37,326
- How's that?
- How's that?

339
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:38,649
I hated it.

340
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,522
Do whatever. I don't care anymore.

341
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:43,821
Liar.

342
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:54,706
In truth...

343
00:29:57,144 --> 00:29:58,550
I want to hear more.

344
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,378
Everyone, social cultures

345
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,222
(Social Culture Characteristics)
help organize chaos in society.

346
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:14,267
What you see on the board
are their characteristics.

347
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,952
Social Culture Characteristics:

348
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,727
1. Complexity

349
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,069
2. Diversity

350
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,831
3. Fluctuation

351
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,700
4. Correlation

352
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:30,133
5. Social meanings

353
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:35,336
On complexity, what's crucial is...

354
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,831
human interaction in society.

355
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:42,292
What makes a good social structure
may be everyone...

356
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,344
You're not eating?

357
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,036
No appetite.

358
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,751
You need feeding these days.
Open up.

359
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,359
All right, Young Master.
Open up, sir. Ah!

360
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:56,384
Quit it.

361
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,881
It's cloudy and you're moody.

362
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,469
But why didn't Se-heon show?

363
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,082
Don't care. Quit talking about him.

364
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:09,953
You care.

365
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,781
You were watching
his seat all morning.

366
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,469
- I was?
- Yeah. I noticed.

367
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:20,036
Take your time. I'm gonna go.

368
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,084
Han Tae-yi is being weird.

369
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:36,911
Yoon Se-heon.

370
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:42,266
Why do you... keep bothering me?

371
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,340
Can... can you stop
playing for a bit?

372
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,340
You're so adorable,

373
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:26,372
Se-heon.

374
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,250
Senior.

375
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,200
- Why... why are you doing this?
- Just stay still.

376
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,580
It hurts.

377
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:33,703
Wait a minute.

378
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:08,821
"Jazz for Two"

379
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,012
(Next Episode) Se-heon's super charming
and he plays piano very well.

380
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:14,315
Your girlfriend sent me to get you.

381
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:17,301
Our music class' practical exam
is coming up.

382
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:19,904
Se-heon hasn't found anyone.
Should we put him in our band?

383
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:20,981
I told you not to go.

384
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:22,483
Why should I do as you say?

385
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:24,331
If you can, stay away
from Senior Ju-ha.

386
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,143
Senior, what should I do?

387
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:29,126
Let me help you.
Make sure to dress up.

388
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:32,265
He's riled up
at the mention of Se-heon.

389
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,510
Are you sane?
Why did you come here?

390
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,510
What's wrong with Senior Ju-ha?

391
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,505
He's way better than you
who's always mad at the world.

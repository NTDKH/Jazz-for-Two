00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:21,212
Hey.

8
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,323
Why are you in the rain?

9
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:28,381
You'll catch a cold.

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,379
What's this? Are you crying?

11
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,753
Aside from this place...

12
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,891
I have nowhere else to go.

13
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:04,780
I figured it would be this way.

14
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,991
You couldn't control it
from the beginning.

15
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:16,449
Now it feels like
I can't control it either.

16
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,363
It's too late to go back now.

17
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:22,935
And I don't want to go back.

18
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:25,957
Right now...

19
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,629
I don't know anymore.

(Episode 1: Summer Time)

21
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,921
My father is a professor
at a famous music university

22
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,225
and a classical piano master.

23
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,045
My older brother...

24
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,619
(Grand Prize - Yoon Se-jin)
won the university's scholarship

25
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:05,724
(National Youth Piano Champion)
and is a noted pianist.

26
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,521
And the mutant of
this classical music family...

27
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,856
is me.

28
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,896
Even with sleeping and eating,

29
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,635
if I don't make time to practice,

30
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:17,992
I won't survive in this house.

31
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,690

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Yes?

33
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,584
You've practiced this song
a hundred times.

34
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:04,011
Why do you still read
the sheet music?

35
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,045
You kept looking
at the sheet music.

36
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,157
Haven't you memorized it?

37
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:10,959
Well...

38
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,693
I cut back my time spent on
eating, sleeping, showering...

39
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:21,387
I'm back.

40
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,515
- You're home early.
- Yes.

41
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,950
Did it go well
with the department head?

42
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,302
Yes, I informed him.

43
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,053
Is the practice going well?

44
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:32,474
Uh...

45
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,641
Disastrous.
He needs a lot more practice.

46
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:38,976
May I be excused?

47
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,323
- I have things to prepare.
- Mm, go on.

48
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,489
What about your school?

49
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,454
Actual class
doesn't start tomorrow.

50
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,298
Just have to go get
my books and uniforms.

51
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,161
I see.

52
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,661
I'm going to my room.

53
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:07,170
Once school starts,
see how other kids play.

54
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,158
I will.

55
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,220
You do know if you miss practice,

56
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:12,857
you'll fall behind.

57
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:14,795
I'm well aware.

58
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,825
But...

59
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,743
the reason I increased
my practice time...

60
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:30,929
which almost kills me...

is to inspire myself.

64
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,969
Goodbye, the days consisted
of eating, sleeping, practicing.

65
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,685
I'm now free!

66
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,839
- Yoon Se-heon?
- Yes?

67
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:55,311
- What are you doing?
- Uh, getting ready for bed.

68
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,168
I got a little excited for school.

69
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,054
Mm.

70
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,920
Thank you very much.

71
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,215
Next, a song from
our first jazz pianist.

72
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,360
Performed by Yoon Se-heon.

73
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,162
Yoon Se-heon?

74
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,618
Why are you making stupid faces?

75
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,790
What's this? When did you get in?!

76
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,571
A while ago.

77
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,196
Knock first, would you?

78
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:25,804
I did knock.

79
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:29,024
I didn't hear you.

80
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,071
What's up?

81
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,135
You said school started tomorrow.

82
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:34,616
So what?

83
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,888
I thought you'd be sad
getting scolded by Dad.

84
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:39,368
You look cheerful.

85
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:42,491
Because I'm always scolded.

86
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,227
You've taken a one-year break.
You must have missed school.

87
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,852
What break? You've seen me.

88
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,972
I practice every day
like a lunatic.

89
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,134
True, homeschooling isn't relaxing.

90
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:00,493
Not up to anything, are you?

91
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:02,743
Of course not.

92
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay. But try not to hate Dad.

93
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,602
- Take that.
- What's that?

94
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,493
Things.

95
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:15,486
Songbooks and
my old composition books.

96
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,747
What's the hurry?

97
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,450
My studying abroad
starts earlier than I thought.

98
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,970
It's going well, right?

99
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,188
Hang in there.

100
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,853
Don't let Dad find out
about jazz music.

101
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,758
- When do you leave?
- Don't know.

102
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,349
Jeez, what a bore.

103
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,196

104

(Uncle Eun-sang)
Know where we must go today?

105
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,412
I'll pick you up at school at one.

106
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:19,335
(Wooyeon Arts School)
Jeez.

107
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,890
Isn't it this way?

108
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:31,600
Weird. It says
this is the right way.

109
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,695
By the way, can you
really go alone tomorrow?

110
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:43,744
- I'm not a little kid.
- But always been homeschooled.

111
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,625
Do you know how to take a bus?

112
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:48,394
Of course.

113
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,566
I answered so vehemently.

114
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,401
But I don't know
how to do anything.

115
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:56,673
What do I do?

116
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:06,392
Excuse me?

117
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:10,516
- Do you mind?
- Yes?

118
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:14,307
Do you know how to get to
Wooyeon Arts School?

119
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know.

You're here, Tae-hyun.

123
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,059
You know where
Wooyeon Arts School is?

124
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:31,345
Wooyeon Arts?

125
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,102
A bit further that way.

126
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:34,899
Really?

127
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:36,805
I guess so.

128
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,111
Thank you.

129
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,532
- Did you get his number?
- What?

130
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,651
- You're acting suspicious.
- How?

131
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:54,786
Let's go.

132
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,516
Today's hotter than usual, eh?

133
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,847
It's hot.

134
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,849
Yes. Hot and we still
have to go to school.

135
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,638
Oh, tomorrow's your birthday.

136
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,515
Don't you want anything?

137
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,038
I'll buy it especially for you.

138
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:16,157
No.

139
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:19,802
Internet café today?

140
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,943
- I have to leave early.
- Where to?

141
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
You don't need to know.

142
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:30,848
Jeez, you're in a bad mood today.

143
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:35,957
What? What's wrong?

144
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,147
It popped out again.

145
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,019
Are you okay?

146
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,620
Damn it. You're dead.

147
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:45,937
You bought that?

148
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,160
School uniform.

149
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:57,131
School uniform and PE uniform.

150
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,310

- No.

155
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,479
Professor Yoon asked us
to take special care of you.

156

Ah. My father?

157
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:27,191
I heard you took
a long break to play piano.

158
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:32,284
If you have trouble adjusting
or any worries, come see me.

00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:38,998
You're the same, Tae-yi.

170
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,249
Hardly talk, bad manners...

171
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:44,637
No respect for seniors.

172
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,243
Can we go past?

173
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:49,192
You can't.

174
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,129
Damn.

175
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,259
I don't know why...

176
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,149
my Ju-hee fancies someone like you.

177
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:07,575
Mystery.

178
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:12,243
Since my dearest sister
fancies you,

179
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:16,555
make sure you dress well.

180
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:19,761
Go on.

181
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,211
How could you?

182
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,105
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

183
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,218
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

184
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,115
Huh?

185
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:57,186
We collided because
you listened to loud music.

186
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:59,280
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

187
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,093
I'm not an outsider.

188
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,874
Actually, I'm an outsider
only until tomorrow.

189
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,562
It's dented. See?

190
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:07,661
- What do I do?
- I'm sorry.

191
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,045
- But you were running...
- Please be careful next time.

192
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,405
No more headphones.

193
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,123
Wait, Miss?

194
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,556
Uh... where's
the piano practice room?

195
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,479
Eh?

196
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,241
(Practice Room 1)

197
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:18,068
(Practice Room 1)

198
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,249
Excuse me?

199
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:34,857
Is anyone in there?

200
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:28,356
Listen. This part
is really fun to play.

201
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:34,382
This is a dream.

202
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:36,936
That I know.

203
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:45,359
Even though its pattern
changes every time...

204
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,041
How's that?

205
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,591
It always ends...

206
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:53,477
the same way.

207
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Is that piano?

208
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:10,432
The sound...

209
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,830
comes from the practice room.

210
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,172
Who... can it be?

211
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:56,136
Or...

212
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:21,199
Who...

213
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:23,948
are you?

214
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:40,495
- I asked who the hell you were.
- Huh?

215
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:41,937
Uh, wait a minute.

216
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:43,929
How did you get in
to play this damned piano?

217
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,924
Uh, you're mistaken.
I'm not an outsider.

218
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,632
- Starting tomorrow...
- Shut up.

219
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,036
If I see you play
piano here again...

220
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:55,268
you're dead.

221
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,476
Please let go of my shirt.

222
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,339
Get lost.

223
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,428
I said get lost.

224
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,856
Didn't even say goodbye.

225
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:52,810
Damn it, what time you call this?

226
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,058
What took you so long?

227
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,198
- What happened?
- Nothing.

228
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,309
So bland.

229
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,340
What are you doing tomorrow
evening? Come to the shop?

230
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,388
- Why?
- Duh.

231
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:13,818
Tomorrow's my dearest
nephew's birthday.

232
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,701
I'm inviting you to dinner. Yes?

233
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:16,868
No.

234
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,903
Let's celebrate your birthday.

235
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:23,572
Will you drive already?

236
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,567
Let's go.

237
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,504
How long again?

238
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,262
- Two and a half hours?
- Nice.

239
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:37,148
- You should have rushed me.
- Whatever.

240
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,803
It was you who were late.
Why are you yelling at me?

241
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:12,573
We're here.

242
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:15,835
Are you happy there?

243
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:19,261
I miss you, Tae-joon.

244
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,257
Say something.

245
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:28,403
- Let's go.
- Hm?

246
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:43,759
Tae-yi just needs more time.

247
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,366
(Han Tae-joon)
(Free to fly anywhere)

248
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,736
I'll come again next year.

249
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,033
See you, my boy.

250
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,317
If I see you play
piano here again...

251
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:02,613
you're dead.

252
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:05,493
God damn him. That bastard!

253
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,199
My neck still hurts.

254
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,489
Let me go and let's talk.

255
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:16,098
They should have put up
a sign to forbid outsiders.

256
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:19,576
And I'm not an outsider.
I'm a student here now!

257
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:25,889
Jeez, I should have said that.
What an idiot!

258
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,207
Damn it!

259
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:45,925
I wanna play again.

260
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,455
Isn't there a way?

261
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:04,629
This song again?

262
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:07,740
Why do you like it so much?
It's all you play.

263
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,163
Yeah, I love it.

264
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,296
I love playing this song
so much I'd die for it.

265
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:31,466
If I wake up like this...

266
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,339
I can't go back to sleep.

267
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:48,745
The fading memory...

268
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,245
is suddenly clear again.

269
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,331
I thought I'd forgotten some of it.

270
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,635
Why does this happen again?

271
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:24,598
It must be...

272
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,619
because of that guy.

273
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,150
Whatever.

274
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,557
I'll never see him again.

275
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:42,724
You look good in school uniform.

276
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:45,745
Right?

277
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,269
Don't worry too much.
All kids in this class are nice.

278
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,128
Okay.

279
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,425
Shall we?

280
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,823
(Grade 11 Room 1 Schedule)
But it's true, man.

281
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,789
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

282
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,858
- Handsome guy.
- A newbie.

283
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:09,556
Quiet down.

284
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:11,855
There's a new student in our class.

285
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,190
Make a short introduction.

286
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,632
Hello, I'm new at
Wooyeon Arts School.

287
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,686
I'm Yoon... Se...

288
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:02,648
"Jazz for Two"

289
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:05,271
- You were in the haunted practice room.
- Haunted?

290
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,873
It's an old practice room.
It hasn't been maintained.

291
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:10,217
I gave you a clear warning.

292
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,614
Did you ignore my warning?

293
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:13,709
Are you crazy?

294
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,734
Can I join you?

295
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,723
Hey, Suh Do-yoon,
can't you mark him properly?

296
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,473
Jeez, this is so annoying. Shit.

297
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:23,774
Why are you being nice to him?

298
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,820
Se-heon's clueless. It's hilarious.

299
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Jealous?

300
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,596
- You two close?
- He's my boyfriend.

301
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:29,908
Your boyfriend?!

302
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:32,382
Must I destroy this piano
so you stop coming?

303
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:33,619
What are you two doing?
